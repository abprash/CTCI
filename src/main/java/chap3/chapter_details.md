# This chapter is about stacks and queues.
* Stacks
	* LIFO data structure.
	* Associated methods - push, pop, isEmpty, top.
	* Can be used to implement recursive algorithms iteratively.
	
* Queues
	* FIFO data structure. Can be implemented with a linked list.
	* Is an abstract data type in Java. Linked list of often good enough.
	* Associated methods include - add, remove (alternatively offer and poll respectively), isEmpty.
	* Frequently used for implementing caches and performing breadth first searches.
