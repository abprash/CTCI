# Trees and Graphs
* Trees are basically special kind of graphs.
* Different kinds of trees
	* Binary trees.
	* N-ary trees. (Each node can have n children at most)

* Different kinds of Binary trees
	* Full Binary Tree - Every node has either 2 or no children.
	* Complete Binary tree - Every node is filled fully (possibly) except the last row. And it is filled from left to right.
	* Perfect Binary Tree - The entire tree is filled, as, each nodes have 2 children, and all levels are perfectly filled.
* Tree Traversals
	* DFS
		* Preorder
		* Inorder
		* Postorder
	* BFS 
		* Level order traversal
* Min and Max Heaps
	* Min heap - top most element is min. So repeated popping will result in an ascending order of elements.
	* Max heap - top most element is max. So repeated popping will result in an descending order of elements.
	* Complexity -
		* Insert - O(log N)
		* Look up min/ max - (for min/ max heap respectively) - O(1)
		* Deletion - O(log N)
		
* Tries	
	* Prefix trees.

* Ways of representing a graph
	* Adjacency list
	* Adjacency matrix
